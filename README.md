Iris - Virtual AI Assistant
Overview
Iris is a voice-activated virtual assistant built with Python, designed to assist users with various tasks using natural language commands. It integrates speech recognition, text-to-speech, machine learning for intent recognition, and APIs for real-time information like news and weather. Iris can perform actions such as opening applications, fetching information from Wikipedia, controlling system volume, and providing schedules or system status updates.

This project leverages multiple libraries and APIs, including ElevenLabs for advanced text-to-speech, NewsAPI for news updates, OpenWeatherMap for weather information, and a pre-trained machine learning model for intent classification.
